# **Flight Ticket Fare and Class Prediction Models - Data Science Project**
In this project, multiple data science techniques such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and ANOVA were used to anaylze the [AirFare ML dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashdharme36/airfare-ml-predicting-flight-fares) and predict both the flight fare of a ticket and the class of a ticket. For more details, see `report.pdf`.
